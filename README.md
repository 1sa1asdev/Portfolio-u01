# Portfolio-u01

Porfolio website for the course "frontend-development" based on this [Figma Sketch](https://linktodocumentation). Built with HTML/CSS/JS to create a one page auto-scroll website, that scrolls to different sections when the user clicks on a corresponding link in the navbar.

## Requirements

- You use modern layout techniques like CSS Flexbox and/or CSS Grid.

- The page must be responsive according to mobile-first and also be adapted for desktop. You choose your own breakpoints; according to the Figma sketch, the mobile layout is 600px and the desktop layout is 1600px.

- The navigation links must lead to their respective subpages (html).

- You use CSS variables to define colors.

- You use Google Fonts to load external fonts.

- There should be a good structure in your CSS, and you can advantageously split it into a base.css and an index.css.

- Good naming in English for all classes.

- Your HTML code must follow good semantics and validate with 0 errors according to https://validator.w3.org/

- Your website must be compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

- You use Git for version control and make several commits with clear messages.

- You publish your Github repo on Netlify through a forked version of the original repo. - Your published link should be in your ReadME.md.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

This was definitely a humbling project, I underestimated the challenges of starting of with desktop to mobile instead of the mobile first approach. Which ultimately had me redoing the whole site in one day. Something I definitely dont want to have to do again.

Although the road to completion was a rocky one I can confidently say that the css and html files are well organized. And though I didn't have time to finish the dark mode which I will aim to add in the near future. I made a developer branch, so that I implement new features
